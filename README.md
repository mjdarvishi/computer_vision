# Object detection in sattelite images with Yolo and Faster Rcnn Approach

## Overview of the project
In the ED_Analysis file there are analysis for data set and you can find these infomation:
1- Intensity Distribution
2- T-SNE Embedding
3- PCA
4- UMAP
5- heatmap

Insid the YOLO file there is the code for traning, testing and evaluation for the yolo algortim.

For FRRCNN we use two approach one of them is using torch and another one is using the Detectron library.
